My dissertation is on the foundations of human rights. I am most interested in the moral grounds for human rights as opposed to merely legal, political, or practice-based grounds for them. I am currently focusing on the following questions:

In virtue of what do we have human rights?
Is the most plausible ground for human rights able to set apart humans from other non-human animals, or does it render the distinction morally irrelevant?
Can we justify human rights (as moral rights) instrumentally, or do we need a non-instrumental justification?

I edit the [Justifications of Human Rights category](https://philpapers.org/browse/justifications-of-human-rights) on PhilPapers.
